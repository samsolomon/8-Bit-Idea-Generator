== Startup Idea Generator

This Ruby on Rails application takes data from two text files and reads them into separate arrays. One array contains a list of popular startups, the other contains a target demographic for that startup. Two items from each list are randomly assigned.The result is a "this for that" startup idea generator.

The live generator can be seen at http://ideabit.herokuapp.com/
